// ============================================================================
// StreamRetryPolicy.swift — A print sink that survives stream retries without
// reprinting already-emitted output.
//
// The streaming model response is wrapped in `withRetry`. A retryable error
// thrown mid-stream (rateLimited, concurrentRequest, assetsUnavailable) causes
// `withRetry` to re-run the whole streaming operation from scratch. The model
// emits cumulative snapshots, so a re-run starts from an empty snapshot and
// re-accumulates the same prefix. If each attempt printed its own deltas
// independently, the already-streamed prefix would be reprinted on every retry
// — the user sees duplicated output (#182).
//
// `StreamPrintSink` is the seam. The streaming loop feeds it each cumulative
// snapshot; the sink tracks a high-water mark of how many characters it has
// already emitted and prints only the suffix beyond that mark. Sharing ONE sink
// instance across all retry attempts means a re-run that re-streams an
// already-printed prefix emits nothing until the stream surpasses where the
// previous attempt failed — output is printed exactly once, live, in order.
//
// The sink is an actor so it is Sendable and safe to share across the
// isolation hops a retried async operation crosses. It is pure (no
// FoundationModels dependency) and deterministically unit-testable: feed it a
// scripted sequence of cumulative snapshots simulating a failed-then-retried
// stream and assert each character is emitted exactly once, in order.
